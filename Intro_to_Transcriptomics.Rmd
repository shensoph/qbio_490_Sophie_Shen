***Deliverables***
-Upload this R Notebook to your GitHub and submit the link to your Repo on Brightspace.
-Include any graphs or figures created in this assignment in the folder with your R notebook with descriptive file names.

Since this is an optional partner activity, it is okay if your answers are the same as your partnerâ€™s as long as everyone understands it and could explain it in their own words if asked. Each person must individually push their code to Github. *At the top of your R Notebook, write the name of you and your partner(s) as a comment.*

***Complete the following coding activity and answer any following questions as comments in your R Notebook***

In SummarizedExperiment Tutorial, you learned how to manipulate the SummarizedExperiment data structure and turn it into more readable dataframes, saving them as rna_counts, rna_clinical, and rna_genes. In this semi-guided assignment, you will use these dataframes to perform differential expression analysis based on tumor status.

*Pre-Assignment*
Use knitr function to set your working directory to your analysis_data folder in 490_cluster.
```{r setup}
    knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath("~/490_cluster/analysis_data")) 
```

Load in all necessary packages

If DESeq2 or EnhancedVolcano are not already installed, install it now
```{r}
if (!require("DESeq2", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
if (!require("EnhancedVolcano", quietly = TRUE))
BiocManager::install("EnhancedVolcano")
```

Load in all necessary packages
```{r}
library(TCGAbiolinks)
library(DESeq2)
library(EnhancedVolcano)
```

*1*
Read in the rna_clinical, rna_genes, and rna_counts dataframes which you made in the "SummarizedExperiment Guided Tutorial" R Notebook

```{r}
rna_clinical <- read.csv("../brca_rna_clinical_data.csv")
rna_genes <- read.csv("../brca_rna_gene_data.csv")
rna_counts <- read.csv("../brca_rna_count_data.csv", row.names=1)
```


*2*
In this assignment, you will run differential expression analysis comparing patient samples by whether the sample is from a tumor or normal tissue (this is the definition column in rna_clinical). You will need to choose a variable to control for covariance of: age and/or PAM50 subtype (paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50). 

Manipulate those columns so that they are ready for differential expression analysis (hint: what kind of variables are they? what data type are they by default? do you need to handle unknown values?) Filter out genes with a total expression across all patients less than 1000.
```{r}
rna_clinical[,"Tissue Type"] <- ifelse(rna_clinical$definition == 'Primary solid Tumor', 'Tumor', ifelse(rna_clinical$definition == 'Solid Tissue Normal', 'Normal', NA))
rna_clinical[, "Age"] <- rna_clinical[, "age_at_index"]
rna_clinical[,"Tissue_Type"] <- factor(rna_clinical[,"Tissue Type"])


rna_clinical[,"PAM50_Subtype"] <- factor(rna_clinical$paper_BRCA_Subtype_PAM50)

for(i in 1:dim(rna_clinical)[1]){
  if(rna_clinical[i, 'Tissue_Type'] == 'Normal' & !is.na(rna_clinical[i, 'Tissue_Type'])) {
    for(j in 1:dim(rna_clinical)[1]){
      if(rna_clinical[i, 'patient'] == rna_clinical[j, 'patient'] & !is.na(rna_clinical[j, 'PAM50_Subtype'])) {
        rna_clinical[i, 'PAM50_Subtype'] = rna_clinical[j, 'PAM50_Subtype']
      }
    }
  }
}


NA_mask <- is.na(rna_clinical[, "Tissue_Type"])
NA_mask <- NA_mask | is.na(rna_clinical[, "Age"])
NA_mask <- NA_mask | is.na(rna_clinical[, "PAM50_Subtype"])

rna_clinical_masked <- rna_clinical[!NA_mask,]
rna_counts_masked <- rna_counts[,!NA_mask]

counts_mask <- rowSums(rna_counts_masked) >= 1000
rna_counts_masked <- rna_counts_masked[counts_mask,]
rna_genes_masked <- rna_genes[counts_mask, ]

```


*3*
Perform the differential expression analysis, All you need to do is fill in the appropriate # terms
```{r}
?DESeqDataSetFromMatrix
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = rna_counts,
                             colData = rna_clinical,
                             design = ~age_category)

?DESeq
dds_obj <- DESeq(dds)

resultsNames(dds_obj)
results <- results(dds_obj, format = "DataFrame", contrast = c("age_category", "young", "old")) 
```

Prepare results dataframe for EnhancedVolcano plotting. Add two columns, "-log10(padj)" and "gene_name". Fill in these columns appropriately.
Prepare results dataframe for EnhancedVolcano plotting. Add two columns, "-log10(padj)" and "gene_name". Fill in these columns appropriately.
```{r}
results <- data.frame(rna_genes$gene_name, results@rownames, results@listData$log2FoldChange, results@listData$pvalue, results@listData$padj, -log10(results@listData$padj))
colnames(results) <- c("Gene Name", "Gene ID", "Log2 Fold Change", "P-value", "PAdj", "-log10(PAdj)")
sig_results <- results[results$PAdj < 0.05, ]
my_example_df = data.frame(x = c('index 1', 'index 2', 'index 3', 'index 4', 'index 5'),
                   y = c(2,4,3,5,1))
order_indexes = order(my_example_df$y) # order by column "y"
order_indexes
my_example_df = my_example_df[order_indexes, ] # this rewrites the df based on the sorted rows
my_example_df
up_reg_results <- sig_results[order(sig_results$`Log2 Fold Change`, decreasing = TRUE), ]
up_reg_results <- up_reg_results[up_reg_results$`Log2 Fold Change` > 1, ]
down_reg_results <- sig_results[order(sig_results$`Log2 Fold Change`, decreasing = FALSE), ]
down_reg_results <- down_reg_results[down_reg_results$`Log2 Fold Change` < -1, ]

```

*4*
Now we will use the EnhancedVolcano package to plot our results. The code is already completed and should run without adjustment if all code up to here is correct.
```{r}
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
EnhancedVolcano(results,
                lab = results$`Gene Name`,
                x = 'Log2 Fold Change',
                y = 'PAdj',
                title = 'Gene Expression in Older Patients',
                labSize = 5.0)
```

# Explain what genes from each part of the Volcano Plot mean in terms of their significance and up/down regulation. 
top-right genes: upregulated in tumor, significant
bottom-right genes: upregulated in tumor, not significant
top-left genes: downregulated in tumor, significant
bottom-left genes: downregulated in tumor, not significant
top-middle genes: neutral, significant
bottom-middle genes: neutral, not significant

Save the picture of the volcano plot (using either ggsave() or right clicking and manually downloading the image and push this .Rmd and the image to GitHub)
